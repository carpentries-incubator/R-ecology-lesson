<h2 id="what-are-r-and-rstudio">What are R and RStudio?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-r-and-rstudio"></a></h2>
<p><code>R</code> refers to a programming language as well as the software that interprets R code.</p>
<p><a href="https://rstudio.com" class="external-link">RStudio</a> is a software interface that can make it easier to write R scripts and interact with the R software. It’s a very popular platform, and RStudio also maintains the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" class="external-link"><code>tidyverse</code></a> series of packages we will use in this lesson.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="r-does-not-involve-lots-of-pointing-and-clicking-and-thats-a-good-thing">R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-does-not-involve-lots-of-pointing-and-clicking-and-thats-a-good-thing"></a></h3>
<p>Since R is a programming language, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.</p>
<p>Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.</p>
<p>Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.</p>

<h3 id="r-code-is-great-for-reproducibility">R code is great for reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-code-is-great-for-reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p>Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.</p>
<p>R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.</p>
<p>An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-is-interdisciplinary-and-extensible">R is interdisciplinary and extensible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-is-interdisciplinary-and-extensible"></a></h3>
<p>With tens of thousands of packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.</p>

<p>The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.</p>
<p>R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.</p>
<p>R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-produces-high-quality-graphics">R produces high-quality graphics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-produces-high-quality-graphics"></a></h3>
<p>R has well-developed plotting capabilities, and the <code>ggplot2</code> package is one of, if not the most powerful plotting language today. We will begin learning to use <code>ggplot2</code> in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-has-a-large-and-welcoming-community">R has a large and welcoming community<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-has-a-large-and-welcoming-community"></a></h3>
<p>Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" class="external-link">Stack Overflow</a>, or on the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">RStudio community</a>.</p>
<p>Since R is very popular among researchers, most of the help communities and learning materials are aimed towards other researchers. Python is a similar language to R, and can accomplish many of the same tasks, but is widely used by software developers and software engineers, so Python resources and communities are not as oriented towards researchers.</p>

<h3 id="not-only-is-r-free-but-it-is-also-open-source-and-cross-platform">Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#not-only-is-r-free-but-it-is-also-open-source-and-cross-platform"></a></h3>
<p>Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.</p>

<h2 id="navigating-rstudio">Navigating RStudio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#navigating-rstudio"></a></h2>
<p>We will use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) to write code into scripts, run code in R, navigate files on our computer, inspect objects we create in R, and look at the plots we make. RStudio has many other features that can help with things like version control, developing R packages, and writing Shiny apps, but we won’t cover those in the workshop.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/rstudio_screenshot.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><em>RStudio screenshot</em></p>
</div>
<p>In the above screenshot, we can see 4 “panes” in the default layout:</p>
<ul><li>Top-Left: the <strong>Source</strong> pane that displays scripts and other files.
<ul><li>If you only have 3 panes, and the Console pane is in the top left, press <kbd>Shift+Cmd+N</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+N</kbd> (Windows) to open a blank R script, which should make the Source pane appear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Top-Right: the <strong>Environment/History</strong> pane, which shows all the objects in your current R session (Environment) and your command history (History)
<ul><li>there are some other tabs here, including Connections, Build, Tutorial, and possibly Git</li>
<li>we won’t cover any of the other tabs, but RStudio has lots of other useful features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bottom-Left: the <strong>Console</strong> pane, where you can interact directly with an R console, which interprets R commands and prints the results
<ul><li>There are also tabs for Terminal and Jobs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bottom-Right: the <strong>Files/Plots/Help/Viewer</strong> pane to navigate files or view plots and help pages</li>
</ul><p>You can customize the layout of these panes, as well as many settings such as RStudio color scheme, font, and even keyboard shortcuts. You can access these settings by going to the menu bar, then clicking on Tools → Global Options.</p>
<p>RStudio puts most of the things you need to work in R into a single window, and also includes features like keyboard shortcuts, autocompletion of code, and syntax highlighting (different types of code are colored differently).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="getting-set-up-in-rstudio">Getting set up in RStudio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-set-up-in-rstudio"></a></h2>
<p>It is a good practice to get into the habit of organizing your projects into self-contained folders right from the start. A well-organized project is easier to navigate, more reproducible, and easier to share with others. Your project should contain a top-level folder that contains everything necessary for the project, including data, scripts, and images, all organized into sub-folders.</p>
<p>RStudio provides a “Projects” feature that can make it easier to work on individual projects in R. We will create a project that we will keep everything for this workshop.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Start RStudio (you should see a view similar to the screenshot above).</li>
<li>In the top right, you will see a blue 3D cube and the words “Project: (None)”. Click on this icon.</li>
<li>Click <strong>New Project</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click <strong>New Directory</strong>, then <strong>New Project</strong>.</li>
<li>Type out a name for the project, we recommend <code>R-Ecology-Workshop</code>.</li>
<li>Put it in a convenient location using the “Create project as a subdirectory of:” section. We recommend your <code>Desktop</code>. You can always move the project somewhere else later, because it will be self-contained.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create Project</strong> and your new project will open.</li>
</ol><p>Next time you open RStudio, you can click that 3D cube icon, and you will see options to open existing projects, like the one you just made.</p>
<p>One of the benefits to using RStudio Projects is that they automatically set the <strong>working directory</strong> to the top-level folder for the project. The working directory is the folder where R is working, so it views the location of all files (including data and scripts) as being relative to the working directory. You may come across scripts that include something like <code>setwd("/Users/YourUserName/MyCoolProject")</code>, which directly sets a working directory. This is usually much less portable, since that specific directory might not be found on someone else’s computer. Using RStudio Projects means we don’t have to deal with manually setting the working directory.</p>
<p>There are a few settings we will need to adjust to improve the reproducibility of our work. Go to your menu bar, then click Tools → Global Options to open up the Options window.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/rstudio_settings.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><em>RStudio Global Options</em></p>
</div>
<p>Make sure your settings match those highlighted in yellow. We don’t want RStudio to store the current status of our R session and reload it the next time we start R. This might sound convenient, but for the sake of reproducibility, we want to start with a clean, empty R session every time we work. That means that we have to record everything we do into scripts, save any data we need into files, and store outputs like images as files. We want to get used to everything we generate in a single R session being <em>disposable</em>. We want our scripts to be able to regenerate anything we need, any time we need it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="organizing-your-project-directory">Organizing your project directory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#organizing-your-project-directory"></a></h2>
<p>Using a consistent folder structure across all your projects will help keep a growing project organized, and make it easy to find files in the future. This is especially beneficial if you are working on multiple projects.</p>
<p>We will use a basic structure for this workshop, which is often a good place to start, and can be extended to meet your specific needs. Here is a diagram describing the structure:</p>
<pre><code>R-Ecology-Workshop
│
└── scripts
│
└── data
│    └── cleaned
│    └── raw
│
└─── images
│
└─── documents</code></pre>
<p>Within our project folder (<code>R-Ecology-Workshop</code>), we first have a <code>scripts</code> folder to hold any scripts we write. We also have a <code>data</code> folder containing <code>cleaned</code> and <code>raw</code> subfolders. In general, you want to keep your <code>raw</code> data completely raw, so once you put data into that folder, you do not modify it. Instead, you read it into R, and if you make any modifications, you write that modified file into the <code>cleaned</code> folder. We also have an <code>images</code> folder for plots we make, and a <code>documents</code> folder for any other documents you might produce.</p>
<p>Let’s start making our new folders. Go to the <strong>Files</strong> pane, and check the current directory, highlighted in yellow below. You should be in the directory for the project you just made, in our case <code>R-Ecology-Workshop</code>. You shouldn’t see any folders in here yet.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/files_pane.png" alt=""><p class="caption"><em>Files pane with highlighted directory</em></p>
</div>
<p>Next, click the <strong>New Folder</strong> button, and type in <code>scripts</code> to generate your <code>scripts</code> folder. It should appear in the Files list now. Repeat the process to make your <code>data</code>, <code>images</code>, and <code>documents</code> folders. Then, click on the <code>data</code> folder in the Files pane. This will take you into the <code>data</code> folder, which will be empty. Use the <strong>New Folder</strong> button to create <code>raw</code> and <code>cleaned</code> folders. To return to the <code>R-Ecology-Workshop</code> folder, click on it in the file path, which is highlighted in yellow in the previous image. It’s worth noting that the <strong>Files</strong> pane helps you create, find, and open files, but moving through your files won’t change where the <strong>working directory</strong> of your project is.</p>

<h2 id="working-in-r-and-rstudio">Working in R and RStudio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#working-in-r-and-rstudio"></a></h2>
<p>The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write these instructions in the form of <em>code</em>, which is a common language that is understood by the computer and humans. We call these instructions <em>commands</em>, and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by <em>executing</em> (also called <em>running</em>) the commands.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="console-vs--script">Console vs. script<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#console-vs--script"></a></h3>
<p>You can run commands directly in the R console, or you can write them into an R script. It may help to think of working in the console vs. working in a script as something like cooking. The console is like making up a new recipe, but not writing anything down. You can carry out a series of steps and produce a nice, tasty dish at the end. However, because you didn’t write anything down, it’s harder to figure out exactly what you did, and in what order.</p>
<p>Writing a script is like taking nice notes while cooking- you can tweak and edit the recipe all you want, you can come back in 6 months and try it again, and you don’t have to try to remember what went well and what didn’t. It’s actually even easier than cooking, since you can hit one button and the computer “cooks” the whole recipe for you!</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="console">Console<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#console"></a></h4>
<ul><li>The R console is where code is run/executed</li>
<li>The <strong>prompt</strong>, which is the <code>&gt;</code> symbol, is where you can type commands</li>
<li>By pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, R will execute those commands and print the result.</li>
<li>You can work here, and your history is saved in the History pane, but you can’t access it in the future</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="script">Script<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#script"></a></h4>
<ul><li>A script is a record of commands to send to R, preserved in a plain text file with a <code>.R</code> extension</li>
