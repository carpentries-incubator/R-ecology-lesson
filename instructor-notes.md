In a two half-day format, you could probably complete the "Intro to R and RStudio" and "ggplot2" lessons, and make it about halfway through the "Exploring and understanding data" episode in the first half-day. 

We do **not** recommend splitting the workshop into episodes 1 and 2 on the first half-day and 3 and 4 on the second half-day, as we have found this leaves excess time on the first day and requires rushing or skipping content on the second day.
